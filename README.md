# Omniflow – AI for Good Hackathon Prototype

Omniflow is a trust-first, AI-powered automation and data intelligence platform
designed to make advanced technology accessible to startups, small businesses,
NGOs, and emerging enterprises.

## Problem

real-time insights, transparency, and accountability through dashboards
and audit logs.
